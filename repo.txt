Notes:
Challenges:
CSS - Styling the navigation bar
Building the initial structure using HTML was easy, however when it came to styling and making
sure all the information was display correctly was the tricky part. I first had it where the top
navigation bar were simply links instead of an unordered list of links, and decided to make the change to unordered list of
links to the other pages because I needed to make sure the structure of the links were were one to style the navigation bar.

JS for Slideshow
I contemplated building a slideshow just on the home page, however find out that I could use a array to populate the
slideshow using javascript. However trying to figure out how to make the slideshow automatic was also challenging being
that I do not know javascript syntax that well and would of loved to use framework
